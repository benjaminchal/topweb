        So, I applied to the CAA for permission to launch the balloon in the week starting the 23rd of August and recived this:
    </p>
    <div class="well text-center"><img src="https://s13.postimg.org/6grippeiv/dsfaasefaweasee_Recovered.jpg" class="img"></div>
    <p>
        The problem is that I live on the east coast (Ipswich), this means that a strong north or a northeasterly wind will put me in the sea.
        This means very specific wind conditions would be needed; namely a week north wind.
        Unfortunately, all the days between the 23rd and 26th would have seen my balloon land in the sea.
        This is annoying, however, luckily on my part, I am able to return the helium for a full refund (as it is completely un-used).
        So I guess attempt 1 of the launch is a failure.
